# firebase-todo

ToDo Lists are probably the `Hello World` project of learning a new framework etc.<br>
This is my Xth ToDo list after trying out plain JS, Vue and other languages. This time to learn the basics of Firebase.
<br>
Firebase credentials go into the /src/firebase.js file, database name is "tasks" by default but can be changed in main.js.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
